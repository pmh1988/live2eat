Live2Eat is an innovative calorie-tracking application that uses food image detection to automate the process of logging meals. The app is designed to be seamlessly integrated with a user's social media content, allowing them to easily track their food intake throughout the day. One of the key features of Live2Eat is its ability to detect local dishes, making it an ideal tool for travelers and foodies who want to keep track of their diet while exploring new cuisines.

The project was developed by a team of three members during a two-week program at Le Wagon Institute. Our team was inspired to create Live2Eat in response to the common pain points that hinder health and wellness programs from becoming permanent lifestyle changes. We recognized that traditional calorie-tracking methods can be time-consuming and cumbersome, making it difficult for people to stay on track with their goals.

Our solution was to develop an app that simplifies the process of calorie tracking by using advanced image recognition technology to identify and log meals automatically. This approach reduces the time and effort required to track food intake, making it more accessible and manageable for users. By integrating Live2Eat with social media, we hope to make calorie tracking a seamless and effortless part of daily life, helping users to stay on track with their health and wellness goals.

Overall, Live2Eat represents a significant innovation in the field of calorie tracking and has the potential to make a real impact on people's lives. Our team is proud of the work we have accomplished and excited about the potential of Live2Eat to help people make lasting, positive changes to their health and wellness habits.


# Data Sources

</p>
The images used in Live2Eat were sourced from a variety of locations, including local food blogs such as DanielFooddairy. Due to the unique nature of local delicacies, we found that images of these foods were not readily available in large quantities online. To address this issue, we leveraged a variety of techniques to generate a diverse set of food images for our dataset.

Firstly, we used Canva, a graphic design platform, to create multiple variations of the same image. This approach allowed us to create a more comprehensive and diverse dataset by generating different angles, lighting, and colors for each image.

Additionally, we used the Keras image data generator to further augment the images in our dataset. This allowed us to apply a range of transformations to the images, including rotation, shearing, and zooming, to increase the diversity of our dataset and improve the performance of our image recognition model.

Overall, the use of local food blogs, Canva, and the Keras image data generator allowed us to create a robust and comprehensive dataset for Live2Eat. Our team is confident that this diverse and well-curated dataset will help to ensure accurate and reliable food image recognition within the app.
